Search bar
We will be building this cool search bar so that we can search for our favourite characters

Pagination
In total there are 800+ characters. In order to display and manage all of these characters, we will be implementing a pagination system where each page will display 20 characters.

Filters
There are lots of labels present in the API. Using them, we can filter our data and search for exactly what we need
